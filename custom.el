;;; custom.el --- Customization file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; I have Emacs update customizations here vice in my `init.el'

;;; Code:

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(package-selected-packages nil)
 '(powershell-indent-level 2 nil nil "Customized with use-package powershell"))
(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(default ((t (:background nil)))))

;;; custom.el ends here
